This project aims to provide a macro view on alpha strategies, it includes various calculations for alpha strategies, including PnL, risk, correlation etc.


# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

### Hardware & Software

*Ideal to run on high spec ISS, if any of the software below are missing, put up PRISM request to be installed*

1. Bloomberg enabled terminal, ensure Bloomberg Excel API is working
2. R (v3.4.3 or later)
3. RStudio (v1.1.423 or later)

### Proficiency

1. User: Minimal
2. Developer:
    a. RMarkdown: Markdown language for document generation
    b. `dplyr`: Package for dataframe manipulation
        i. `%>%`: piping of output
        ii. `mutate`: data manipulation
        iii. `arrange`, `filter`, `select`: sorting, filtering and selecting of columns
        iv. `left_join`: joining of dataframes
        v. `group_by`, `summarise`: grouping and summarising across groups
    c. `ggplot2`
    d. `map`, `map2`, `apply`, `lapply`, `sapply`: Functions for iterating functions of vector/array
    
## Setting up

1. Open RStudio
2. install and setup `tidymas` by running commands
   a. `install.packages("devtools")
   b. `devtools::install_github("yunching/tidymas")`
   c. Set up `strategies.csv` with the relevant strategies

## Running program to generate output

1. Open `Bloomberg` and log in
2. Open `active_risk.Rmd`
3. Click `Knit` > `Knit to Word` or `Run` > `Run All` to run 
4. Wait for program to run, about 5-10mins
5. Open `active_risk.docx` to see output

# Files Overview

## Inputs (Needs to be updated)

1. `strategies.csv`: Contains all the executed/intended strategies, the corresponding instruments, sizes and trade dates. Update by approaching members of each division. Instruments identified by `identifiers`

## Main Program

1. `active_risk.Rmd`: R Markdown file that generates the document containing analysis

# Usage

## Generating document

1. Open `active_risk.Rmd`
2. Click `Knit` > `Knit to Word` 
3. Wait a few minutes for the document to generate

## Adding strategies

1. Get updated strategies / trades from various divisions
2. Open `inputs/strategies.csv`
3. Fill in the rows as necessary
    a. `owner`: `ed`, `cat`,`europe`,`us`
    b. `strategy`: any strategy name will do, use `_` instead of spaces
    c. `type`: `Duration`, `Spread`, `Curve`, `Inflation`, `FX`, `Equity`, `Others`
    d. `open_date` & `close_date`: In the format `yyyymmdd` without spaces or dashes. Do not use Excel built in date formats as it will certainly screw up
    e. `instrument`: ticker of instrument to be traded, matching the identifiers in the `inputs/tickers_XXX` files
    f. `asset_class`: `govt`, `ilb`, `future`, `fx`, `equity`, `cds`. Program searches identifier in the corresponding asset files
    g. `size`: e.g. 0.5 can be used for both 0.5mths OR 0.5% of R2
    h. `size_type`: `months`, `percent`

## Updating sizes of trades

To updated strategies when there are changes in size, there are two ways to do it:

***Method 1***: Recommended for partial close of trade, or big changes in trade

Close existing entries for the trade, and key in a new trade on the close date

***Method 2***: Recommended for add-on of a position

If trade is increase in size, you can add a new trade with the size increase (without closing the previous trade)

## Adding instruments

This program supports the following asset classes, any other asset classes will need to be developed

1. Futures 
2. Bonds (Govt and ILBs)
3. Equity indices
4. FX
5. CDS

Developer note:
If there are instruments that have been omitted, you can add them by opening the `inst/extdata/tickers_XXX.csv` file and adding a new row for the asset. Please note for the following assets:

1. **FX:** does not need to be added, as the required tickers are computed on the fly*
2. **Bonds:** Only total return indices should be used

## Adding scenarios

If any return or risk simulation needs to be done over a specified period in history, it can be added to `active_risk.rmd` file, it will be automatically added to the outputs which rely on the scenarios. 

# Methodology

## Size of trade

The size of trades are all converted to percentage terms, meaning `% of R2` in order to compute returns.

### Percent

If input trade sizes are in `percent`, the percentage is taken directly to be the weight, no adjustment is performed

### Duration (months)

When input size is in `duration` contribution in `months`: 

$$percent.weight_{i,t} = \frac{month.weight_{i,t}}{modified.duration_{i,t} \times 12}$$

- $i$: instrument

## Size of strategy

Size of strategy is calculated by taking first summing all the positive sizes of instruments, and summing all the negative sizes. The higher absolute of positve or negative is taken to be the size of the trade. For example, a flattener of 10y vs 2y with months weighted size of 0.5 months, will be converted to approximately size of 0.5mths / (dur 10y * 12) = 0.42%, while 2years will be -2.08%, the size of the strategy is taken to be 2.08% as it is larger of 0.42% and 2.08%.

$$strategy.weight_{s,t} = max(\sum_i f(instr.weight_{i, t}), \sum_i g(instr.weight_{i,t})) \\
f(x) = \begin{cases} 
x \text{ for } x > 0 \\
0 \text{ for } x \le 0   
\end{cases} \\
g(x) = \begin{cases} 
|x| \text{ for } x < 0 \\
0 \text{ for } x \ge 0   
\end{cases}$$

- $s$ is the strategy id
- $i$ is the instrument id
- $f(x)$ are the positive size instruments
- $g(x)$ are the negative size instrument

## Returns of instruments

Returns are calculated on a daily basis by using Bloomberg data, based on the below calculations

### Bonds and Equity indices

*Bonds use total return indices* to calculate returns

$$return_{i,t} = \frac{index_{i,t}}{index_{i,t-1}} - 1$$

### Futures

$$return_{i,t} = \frac{contract.value_{i,t}}{contract.value_{i,t-1}} - 1$$

### FX

$$
\begin{aligned}
return_{i,t} &= price.return_{i,t} + funding.return_{i,t} \\
&= (\frac{price_{i,t}}{price_{i,t-1}} - 1) + (left.depo_{i,t-1} - right.depo_{i,t-1})
\end{aligned}
$$

### CDS

$$return_{i,t} = \frac{price_{i,t}}{price_{i,t-1}} - 1$$

## Weighted Return of strategies

Weighted return of strategies are simply the weight of the instruments multipled by the daily return

$$weighted.return_{s,t} = \sum percent.weight_{i,t} \times return_{i,t} $$

## Unweighted return of strategy

To get the unweighted return of strategy, which is used to calculate correlation of trades and active risks, we take weighted return divided by the percentage weight. Note that we will have to simulate positions in order to calculate unweighted return of strategies. This is done by projecting the sizes forward and backward 

$$unweighted.return_{s,t} = weighted.return_{s,t} \div percent.weight_{s,t}$$

## Active Risk

$$\textbf{X} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
percent.weight_{1, t=last} \\ percent.weight_{2, t= last} \\ percent.weight_{3, t=last} \\ ... \\ percent.weight_{n, t=last}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$\sigma_{i,j} = cov(unweighted.return_i, unweighted.return_j)$$
$$ 
\Sigma = cov.matrix = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_1^2 & \sigma_{1,2} & ... & \sigma_{1,n} \\
... & ... & ... & ... \\
\sigma_{i, 1} & \sigma_{i,2} & ... & \sigma_{i,n} \\
... & ... & ... & ... \\
\sigma_{1, n} & \sigma_{2, n} & ... & \sigma_n^2 
\end{bmatrix}  
$$
$$\sigma(X) = \textbf{X}^T \times \Sigma \times \text{X}$$

$$\textbf{MR} = \frac{1}{\sigma(X)}(\textbf{X}^T \times \Sigma)$$
$$\textbf{AR} = \textbf{MR} \cdot \textbf{X} $$

- $\textbf{X}$: vector of portfolio weights of strategies
- $\Sigma$: covariance matrix
- $\sigma(X)$: portfolio standard deviation
- $\textbf{MR}$: vector of marginal risk of strategies
- $\textbf{AR}$: vector of active risk of strategies
