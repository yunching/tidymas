## Version Numbers

This package uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). In essence, the package's version is of the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH and increments using the below logic:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
